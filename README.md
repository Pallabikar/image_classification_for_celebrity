# image_classification_for_celebrity

This project focuses on building an image classification model for recognizing celebrities using deep learning. It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of celebrities based on a trained dataset.

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
Dataset Preparation: Collected and preprocessed celebrity images.

Model Architecture: Implemented CNN-based classification using TensorFlow/Keras.

Training & Evaluation: Fine-tuned the model for optimal accuracy.

Deployment: Integrated with a web interface for real-time predictions.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used:
âœ… Python | âœ… TensorFlow/Keras | âœ… OpenCV | âœ… NumPy | âœ… Flask (for deployment)
